<h2 style="color:orange">What is Programming?</h2>

<p style="font-size:17px">
Programming is the process of designing and creating instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript. Programming enables the development of software applications, websites, games, and systems that power modern technology. It involves logic, problem-solving, and creativity.

<h2 style="color:gold">History of &nbsp;C</h2>

<p style="font-size:17px">
The C programming language was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It was created as an evolution of the B language, which itself was influenced by BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language). C was initially designed to write the Unix operating system, which helped establish its reputation for efficiency and portability.

<p style="font-size:17px">
Released in 1972, C became widely adopted due to its balance of low-level memory access and high-level programming features. It allowed developers to write system-level code, such as operating systems, compilers, and embedded software, with greater control over hardware resources.
</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">
The language was standardized in 1989 by ANSI (as ANSI C, also known as C89) and later by ISO in 1990. Subsequent updates (like C99, C11, and C18) introduced new features while maintaining backward compatibility, making C one of the most enduring and influential programming languages in computer science history.

<h1 style="color:greenyellow">First Program in C</h1>

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
### Output

```
Hello, World!
```
